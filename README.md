# Sentiment-Analysis

The project is based on sentiment analysis performed on tweets related to the 2012 United States presidential election. The dataset used for this task was sourced from Twitter and contains tweets mentioning either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, the two major candidates of that election. The goal of this project was to build a classification model that could accurately predict the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

The sentiment analysis was performed using the BERTweet model, which is a pre-trained deep learning model designed specifically for processing text data from Twitter. The model was fine-tuned on the dataset and evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance. The performance of the model was measured using various metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

The report details the preprocessing steps performed on the dataset, the training of the BERTweet model, and the evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, the report includes the predictions made by the model on a separate test set of tweets, and these predictions were saved to output files for further analysis.
